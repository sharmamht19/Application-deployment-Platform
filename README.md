# Distributed IoT Application Platform

The **Distributed IoT Application Platform** is a project that aims to design and develop a platform where users can run and host their IoT-based applications. This platform provides the capability to interact with various sensors independent of their type, making it flexible and adaptable to different IoT scenarios. The project leverages the oneM2M platform for data gathering, ensuring compatibility with various protocols.

The platform is designed to dynamically understand the application requirements through configuration files. It intelligently selects the most efficient workflows for building and deploying IoT applications, optimizing performance and resource utilization. This dynamic approach allows users to easily adapt and customize the platform based on their specific needs.

The primary purpose of the Distributed IoT Application Platform is to enable organizations to deploy and manage large-scale IoT solutions securely and in a scalable manner. It provides end-to-end functionality, including device and application connectivity, device and data management, data analysis, and security features. The platform empowers users to gain real-time insights, optimize processes, and automate tasks, leading to improved operational efficiency and enhanced decision-making.
